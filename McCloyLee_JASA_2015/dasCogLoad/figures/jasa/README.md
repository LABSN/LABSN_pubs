# Image processing workflow
All the figures are generated as `.svg` images by matplotlib. However, matplotlib `.svg`s have a quirk where the nodes are sub-optimally ordered (one or more root-level `defs` nodes occur after the main drawing node, instead of before). The result is that the `.svg`s (and any `.eps` files created from them) look normal in some viewers, and messed up in others. I've raised [this issue](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/4179) in the matplotlib github repo. In the meantime, the `svg` nodes must be manually reordered before running the conversion script that creates the `.eps` (for `latex`-generated `pdf`) and `.png` (for `pandoc`-generated `docx`). This node reordering can be done with any text editor, but is efficiently accomplished using the XML viewer built into the inkscape GUI. `.svg` files that have undergone this manual node reordering are placed in the folder `manhandled`, which is targeted by the `convertToEPS.bash` script.

In addition, the `.eps` for the `rt-hist` figure cannot be converted using inkscape, because it has overlapping transparency regions. It must be converted from `.svg` to `.eps` using Illustrator to properly preserve appearance without rasterization. However, the inkscape `.svg` to `.png` conversion works just fine.
