This experiment involves small and large categories of words.  

Before you start, you'll do a quick categorization task so you are sure of which words go in which categories. 



Great. In the experiment, the categories will be associated with different spatial locations, and you will need to push a button when you hear a word coming from that location that doesn't match the category.

There will be five training steps so you can get used to the stimuli, with detailed instructions on screen at each step.

After passing training, there will be six blocks of 20 trials each: three blocks of the 3-word categories, and three blocks of the 6-word categories.

Any questions?
